This is a simple library to scale and crop animated gif in Java.
Is used on my other prject java chat.

Use is really simple, GifUtil is class that contain the core method,
so GifUtil.gifInputToOutput(File source, File destination)
is the function that take a gif file input and write that to file dastination.
The function scale image, mantaining aspect ratio,
 at the max sides width MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION , 
that is a static value writed directly on GifUtil class,
edit the code if you need to pass size as paramanter.
